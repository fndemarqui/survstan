# survstan

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The aim of the R package survstan is to provide a toolkit for fitting survival models using Stan. 

The R package survstan can be used to fit right-censored survival data under independent censoring. The implemented models allow the fitting of survival data in the presence/absence of covariates. All inferential procedures are currently based on the maximum likelihood (ML) approach.

## Installation

You can install the development version of survstan from GitHub with:

```{r}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fndemarqui/survstan")
```
