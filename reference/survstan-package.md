# The 'survstan' package.

The aim of the R package survstan is to provide a toolkit for fitting
survival models using Stan. The R package survstan can be used to fit
right-censored survival data under independent censoring. The
implemented models allow the fitting of survival data in the
presence/absence of covariates. All inferential procedures are currently
based on the maximum likelihood (ML) approach.
